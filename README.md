# unnotify
Turn off annoying Twitter "tweet notifications" in one go.

Twitter introduced an annoying new "feature" that notifies you when certain accounts tweet. It's fine if that's what you want and you enabled it, but they just took it upon themselves to add a bunch of "notifiers" to my account, and I get this (1) next to the Notifications icon for no reason other than they are baying for my attention to get me to read tweets. While I'm already reading tweets.
I googled the issue, tried several manual fixes over several weeks, and, with nothing working, whether on the app or the web or mobile browser, I decided to address it programmatically via the API.
Basically, you'll need a PHP environment, a Twitter Developer Account, these two source files, and the abraham/twitteroauth library.
